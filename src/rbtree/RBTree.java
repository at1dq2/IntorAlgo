/**
 * Red-black trees are one of many search-tree schemes that are
"balanced" in order to guarantee that basic dynamic-set operations take O(lg n) time in the
worst case.
1. Every node is either red or black.

2. The root is black.

3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.

4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.

5. For each node, all paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number
of black nodes.
